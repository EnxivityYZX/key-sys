How it works:
- Open index.html. Click "Get Key" to go to the key system.
- Choose Linkvertise or Lootlabs. This calls /api/start (Service Worker) and sends you to a simulated provider page.
- Click "Complete and return" to hit /api/return. The Service Worker generates a unique 10-char key, valid for 24h, and redirects you to /key.html?key=XXXX...
- On the key page, copy the key and note it expires in 24 hours. /api/redeem can be used to validate a key.

Endpoints (implemented in sw.js):
- POST /api/start?source=linkvertise|lootlabs[&name=optional]
  -> {session, redirect}
- GET /api/return?session=...
  -> 302 redirect to /key.html?key=...
- GET /api/redeem?key=...
  -> {valid:boolean, key_text, created_at, expires_at, source?}

Note:
- The backend is simulated entirely in the Service Worker with IndexedDB persistence.
- Background image uses Unsplash and can be replaced at will.
